# CS22002 Web Project

## Description

This project is a web-based application designed to provide a seamless user experience by integrating a modern frontend with a robust backend. The application leverages Flask for backend development and a JavaScript framework for the frontend, enabling efficient data handling and dynamic user interactions. It is built to demonstrate key concepts in modern web development, including RESTful APIs and third-party API integration.
